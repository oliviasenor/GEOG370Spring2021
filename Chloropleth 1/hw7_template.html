<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Olivia Senor</h2>
<h3>This is my map of Ohio! I am originally from Coshocton, Ohio, so I thought it would be fun to check out my home state. Ohio tends to vote red in elections but is a pretty important electoral battleground, so I figured it would be neat to look at how race correlates with election results. Unfortunately, there was not enough data to show up for any other race except white, so I looked at the breakdown of white households. Next to my map, I have included an image of the way each county voted in red and blue; I was really surprised to see that some of the more white-dense counties voted blue. That being said, Ohio ranks in the top ten of states lacking in diversity, so the areas with a high density of white households likely also have a high density of other races. In fact, the blue areas are the areas with some of the highest population density, i.e. metropolitan centers and cities. I therefore reason that the blue areas are blue less because of having a high white population and more because of having higher levels of population density and, by extension, higher levels of overall diversity. </h3>
