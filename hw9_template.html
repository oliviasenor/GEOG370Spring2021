<h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map</h1>
<h2>Olivia Senor</h2>
<h3>This is my map of California! The original CSV featured data on all vaccine-preventable disease instances in all counties in California for the years ranging from 2001-2018. The classification method I used was Natural Breaks (Jenks), as the data, while being skewed toward the lower end of the values, was most clearly displayed utilizing this method. This topic was of particular interest to me as I feel quite passionate about vaccinations and found it interesting to see the impacts that anti-vaxxers are having in a state as large as California. I just hope that they won't, you know, cause the pandemic to last any longer. If you're reading this, please get vaccinated.</h3>
