The neighborhood itself contains five parks which, as stipulated when the land was granted to the City of Portland, may not be disturbed in any way. Sometimes the areas that have not changed are just as meaningful as the ones that have! <br/><img src ='https://tclf.org/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/6092815589_51d7394950_o.jpg'width='100px'/>";

This also required the demolition of a number of buildings, most notably a building complex on the western side of the shore and a circular structure on the eastern side.
